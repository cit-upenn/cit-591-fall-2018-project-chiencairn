Project Description
It's always best to have information about a community before you move there! The Community Rating program can help you, 
whether you are moving or just curious how your neighborhood measures up to the rest of Philadelphia. This program will 
provide you with details about the availability of schools,  proximity of parking, volume of litter, and prominence of crime. 

After running the program, you enter the address that you are interested in and click: "Rate my address!"

The program will, with a brief delay to compare the data for your area, provide you with an overall rating as well as 
individual category ratings.
